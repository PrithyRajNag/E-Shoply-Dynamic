					<p>
						After I donâ€™t know how long, Xiaomi officially pushed the firmware supporting Mesh networking to both Xiaomi AIoT router AX3600 (hereinafter referred to as AX3600) and Xiaomi router AX1800 (hereinafter referred to as AX1800). After the firmware update was completed, Xiaomi finally delivered the pie drawn before to the users. The two low-priced but excellent performance, especially the AX3600, are now even more "scented."

				</p>
				<p>
					The full Chinese name of "Mesh" is "Mesh network", which is a kind of transmission of data and control commands through dynamic routing in a network with multiple network nodes. In the entire mesh network, all nodes can achieve point-to-point transmission. If a node fails, the entire network architecture can skip this node and find a new path for data transmission.Putting it on the home user side, the most intuitive feeling of the Mesh network is that it can cover complex large houses more efficiently. Before using Mesh network networking, it is often necessary to use wired or wireless relay to obtain good Wi-Fi network coverage in various areas in a complex and large space. The Mesh networking is simpler and more stable than the networking done with traditional relays, and it is easy to manage the network as a whole.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Mesh function provided by the AX3600 and AX1800 routers through software upgrades is naturally incomparable to flagship Wi-Fi 6 Mesh routers in terms of absolute intranet performance, switching efficiency and stability. At least through this software Mesh function, Xiaomi A low-cost Mesh coverage solution is provided to many people.
